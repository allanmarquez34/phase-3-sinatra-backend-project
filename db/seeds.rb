Is this the end for me? I mean, a vacation to small town Georgia already felt like death by boredom, so at least murder would be more exciting, you know? He dragged me to the very back of a tunnel‚Äîor was it the back? I can‚Äôt be sure as all around me was dark. I was wholly deprived of my senses. In that moment, I felt an expanse of possibility swell within me. I waited for the icy grip of death, the sweet release to save me from this stupid vacation. But then something extraordinary happened: I felt his hot breath upon my neck. ‚ÄúWill you marry me?‚Äù I gasped. I know I said yes, but I remember not. Suddenly, we were naked. We made love right there on the tunnel floor, our moans of pleasure reverberating through the old mine. Then, the screams of parents and children alike as a lamp flickered on. We turned, naked as the day we were born, to look upon the horrified faces of the tour group. We were kicked out and received a lifetime ban, but I will remember this day and this tour as one of the wildest, most enchanting and exhilarating experiences of my life. 15/10 for both the tour and the orgasm.", rating: 4, activity_id: a1.id)
